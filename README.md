import SearchBar from "./SearchBar";
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

export default function Banner({ setCompany }) {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  return (
    <Box
      sx={{
        alignItems: "stretch",
        backgroundImage: `url('${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/assets/background.png')`,
        backgroundRepeat: "no-repeat",
        backgroundPosition: "center",
        backgroundSize: "cover",
        height: "auto",
        maxWidth: "100%",
        fontSize: "0.875rem",
        fontWeight: "700",
      }}
    >
      <Grid item xs={6} md={4}>
        <Typography sx={{ ml: 4 }}>
          <img
            src="../assets/ja-logo.png"

            width={170}
            height={150}
            onClick={() => navigate("/")}
          />
        </Typography>
      </Grid>
      <Grid container sx={{ justifyContent: "center" }}>

            }}
